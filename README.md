# The Restauranto App
A little app helping prosective restuarant owners make big decisions...

## Deployment
Download the files. You will need to add your own api keys for both google geocoding and the yelp api in the api_keys.py. 

yelp_key = "YOUR KEY HERE" 
google_maps_key = "YOUR KEY HERE" 

Run the app.py from the terminal using: python app.py and using a local server to host the html.

Once running, enter a location. The free version of the yelp api only returns 50 results in a given area so beware.
